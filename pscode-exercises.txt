// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

BEGIN
NUMBER s1, s2, sum
OUTPUT("Input number1:")
INPUT s1
OUTPUT("Input number2:") 
INPUT s2
sum=s1+s2
OUTPUT sum
END

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

BEGIN
PRINT "ENTER ANY NUMBER TO CHECK, EVEN OR ODD" 
READ IMPUT OF A NUMBER
IF NUMBER MOD = 0
PRINT "NUMBER IS EVEN"
ELSE
PRINT "NUMBER IS ODD'
END

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

BEGIN 
input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5  

avg = (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5)/5

If(n1 < n2)
 Set max to n2
Else
 Set max to n1
If(n3 > max)
 Set max to n3
If(n4 > max)
 Set max to n4
If(n5 > max)
Set max to n5
Write "The max is"
Write max

If(n1 > n2)
 Set min to n2
Else
 Set min to n1
If(n3 < min)
 Set min to n3
If(n4 < min)
 Set min to n4
If(n5 < min)
Set min to n5
Write "The min is"
Write min

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

RESULTS 

avg = (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5)/5

SUM = 3

RESULTS 

SMALLEST = 1<

LARGEST = 5>
